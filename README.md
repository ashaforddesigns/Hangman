# Survivor Hangman Game :heart_on_fire:

## Goals
My goal for this project is make a game that you can play in the terminal. I wanted to base the words of one of my favorite tv shows, Survivor. (I actually prefer Big Brother, but I felt like Survivor had more words to choose from)

## Process

### Inspiration
As I continue to lurk around in this community, I realized quickly that hangman is a popular beginner project, and it sounded quite fun and simple enough to me so I found this image as inspiration for it.

and I grabbed [Chris Horton's Hangman images](https://gist.github.com/chrishorton/8510732aa9a80a03c829b09f12e20d9c)

### Gathering the list
Even when I do graphic design work, I always use ChatGPT for copy and I'm planning on using it here to provide a me a list of Survior words. I added some of my favorite players in there for fun also. I could have made it 

### Developing a plan
I always write out a game plan of what I want my python code to do in normal english words and then I "translate" into python. Doing it this way really helps me translate what I want to do in python

### Takeaways 
- I go the chance to use the random library, which I had read about in a [book name here by Al]
- I was going to use phrases also, but the spaces tripped me up. This will be something I will try to learn more about later.
- enummurate() vs index()
- game logic
- python is constantly humbling me
