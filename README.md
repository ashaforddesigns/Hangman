# Survivor Hangman Game :heart_on_fire:

## Goals
My goal for this project is make a game that you can play in the terminal. I wanted to base the words of one of my favorite tv shows, Survivor. (I actually prefer Big Brother, but I felt like Survivor had more words to choose from)

## Process

### Inspiration
As I continue to lurk around in this community, I realized quickly that hangman is a popular beginner project, and it sounded quite fun and simple enough to me so I found this image as inspiration for it.

and I grabbed ![Chris Horton's Hangman images](https://gist.github.com/chrishorton/8510732aa9a80a03c829b09f12e20d9c) so I didn't have to figure out how to draw out the characters themselves. Thanks Chris!

### Gathering the list
Even when I do graphic design work, I always use ChatGPT for copy and I'm planning on using it here to provide a me a list of Survior words. I added some of my favorite players in there for fun also.

### Developing a plan
I always write out a game plan of what I want my python code to do in normal english words and then I "translate" into python. Doing it this way really helps me translate what I want to do in Python. Frequently, when I get really stuck I will go back to that paper and rethink some of the small issues I've come across.

### Takeaways & What I Learned
- I got the chance to use the random library, which I had read about in a Al's book, ("Automate the Boring Stuff with Python")[https://automatetheboringstuff.com]. It's free to read and I'd definitely reccomend it to any beginner! I'll likely go through a lot of the fun projects he provides.

- I was going to use phrases also, but the spaces tripped me up. This will be something I will try to learn more about in the future.
- the **enummurate()** fuction was a new fuction I came across while working this project. **index()** was originally what I wanted to use, but it only finds the first instance of when the hangman letter would show up.

- Game logic. I learned how to word the conditions of the game in a logically way.
- Once again, Python is constantly humbling me, but yet I keep coming back to it. 

I'm looking forward to finally watching some of the hangman tutorials out there to see what other ways people have decided to solve this. Maybe I'll learn something new!
