# Survivor Hangman Game :heart_on_fire:

## Goals
My goal for this project is make a game that you can play in the terminal. I wanted to base the words of one of my favorite tv shows, Survivor. (I actually prefer Big Brother, but I felt like Survivor had more words to choose from)

## Process

### Inspiration

### Gathering the list
